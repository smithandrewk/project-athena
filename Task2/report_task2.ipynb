    "# Approaches\n",
    "First, we aim to generate adversarial examples based on the vanilla ATHENA in the context of the white-box threat model. We use the classic MNIST Dataset containing handwritten digits for the following investigation. Samples in the MNIST Dataset are images of handwritten digits, and labels in the MNIST Dataset are labels corresponding to the digit. The input images are 28 pixels by 28 pixels, and the labels are taken from the set {0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9}. Generating an adversarial example in the context of the MNIST Dataset entails adding perturbations to the image in order to \"fool\" the neural network without greatly distorting the image to the human eye.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some some \"attacks\" which generate adversarial examples:\n",

    "\n",
    "### FGSM\n",
    "The Fast Gradient Sign Method generates an adversarial example which maximizes loss by using gradients of the loss function with respect to the input image. With this method, we find out how much each input pixel contributes to the loss and add perturbations in order to maximize loss in the adversarial example.\n",

    "### PGD\n",
    "The Projected Gradient Descent is a type of attack where the attacker has knowledge of the model’s gradients/weights. (A matrix that corresponds to how the model weighs each particular feature it detects) This threat model focuses on finding the perturbation that maximises the error of particular feature gradient of an input without crossing some threshold labelled as epsilon. The goal here is to find the minimum gradient of features that an input must contain to be classified incorrectly. \n",

    "Notice there are 2 attacks (FGSM,PGD), 3 values of epsilon (0.1,0.3,0.5), and 2 variants of distribution (translation,rotation). Thus, there are 2 x 3 x 2 = 12 total adversarial examples, corresponding to the configs above. We utilize this combination of variant attack methods, variant attack parameters, and variant distribution parameters in order to provide a control for comparison for each changed parameter. This is, after all, the key to scientific investigation. Thus, we may find how each parameter change individually effects the error rate of the adversarial examples.\n",

    "## Computation Cost and Subsampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of generating adversarial examples for all 10,000 images of the MNIST Dataset, we have chosen to do so over a subsample of size 500. We choose this because we have a method of randomly selecting images from the dataset in order to maintain an approximately uniform distribution of class. Additionally, we choose to subsample because of the computational cost of generating adversarial examples for 10,000 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "We infer the execution time of all 12 attack configurations by the following observations and inferences. The following execution times were approximated using the well-known Python module TQDM. First, we observed that TQDM approximated a 30 minute execution time for a subsample of size 200 over all 12 configs. Thus, as 10000 is 50 times 200, we infer that the execution time for a sample of size 10000 will take 30*50 minutes = 1500 minutes = 25 hours. Therefore, we decide to use a subsample of size 500 to descrease this execution time by a factor of 20.\n",

    "\n",

    "## EOT Attack\n",
    "Finally, we choose to employ an adaptive approach which computes the loss expectation over a specific distribution. We use the well-known Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) algorithm, \"a general framework allowing for the construction of adversarial examples that remain adversarial over a chosen transformation distribution T\" [(Athalye, Synthesizing Robust Adversarial Examples)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.07397.pdf). The transformation distribution T is specified by the \"distribution\" key in each config from the above configs description. We utilize a translation distribution and a rotation distribution. \n",

    "# Discussion\n",
    "First, we have seen that increasing the epsilon value in generating adversarial examples and the error rate of the evaluating model are directly related, and this relationship is maintained here. Additionally, It is worth noting that over the \"translation-rotation\" pairs, we observe that the rotation distributon is consistently more effective in generating adversarial examples. Between Task1 and Task2, ATHENA seems to have performed appromxately the same against the adaptive EOT adversarial examples. Regarding the evaluating models, there is a slight improvement with the ATHENA model versus the undefended model. In the evaluation against the PGD-ADT model, the adversarial examples generated with the PGD attacks maintained considerably lower error rates, as expected. Interestingly, a considerable decrease was observed from the undefended model and the ATHENA model to the PGD-ADT model evaluating the adversarial examples generated with the FGSM attack with an epsilon parameter of .5. There was no considerable decrease between the same evaluating models and the higher-epsilon FGSM models. Finally, the evaluation of generated adversarial examples in the context of the white-box threat model in conjunction with the Expectation Over Transformation Algorithm has shown interesting patterns in the effectiveness of the crafted adversarial examples. In future investigations, as we have noted, it would be insightful to compare each dimension to find the most effective parameter, whether it is attack or distribution, in adversarial success. It might be beneficial to explore the principal components of the attack and distribution parameters through a method like Principal Component Analysis."
