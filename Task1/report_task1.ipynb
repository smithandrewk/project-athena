    "# Introduction\n",
    "In this experiment, we perform initial analysis of the effectiveness of the Athena framework in defending Machine\n",
    "Learning models against adversarial attacks. More specifically, we provide analysis of the Athena framework's ability \n",
    "to defend a Convolutional Neural Network, trained on the MNIST handwritten digit data set. We will generate adversarial\n",
    "examples for an undefended CNN and analyse the effectiveness of three different attack methods; Fast Gradient Sign Method,\n",
    "Basic Iterative Method, and Projected Gradient Descent Method, measured by the error rate. This will be used as the measurement\n",
    " of adversarial robustness for the machine learning model. We will use the Athena framework to build an ensemble network\n",
    " of CNNs with weak defenses applied to the input data, i.e. a model with a rotation applied to input data, a model with \n",
    " a shift applied to input data, a model with a gaussian filter applied to input data, etc. By performing inference on \n",
    " the generated adversarial examples, we gain insight into the Athena framework's ability to defend a CNN against \n",
    " adversarial attacks. This will then be compared to the effectiveness of a baseline PGD model to gain insight into\n",
    "  Athena's ability to defend against Adversarial Attacks compared to another method. Our aim in this experiment is to\n",
    "  determine if an ensemble network of Convolutional Neural Networks with weak transformations applied to input data \n",
    "  will be able to successfully increase the adversarial robustness of a model (in this case measured by decreasing\n",
    "  the error rate when performing inference on adversarial examples).\n",
    "   \n",
    "# Implementation\n",
    "In this report, we successfully implemented the attack of three different models; an Undefended Model, a Vanilla Athena \n",
    "Ensemble Model, and a PGD-ADT model. We chose to craft adversarial examples using the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM), \n",
    "Jacobian-based Saliency Map Attack (JSMA), and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD).\n",
    "\n",
    "### FGSM\n",
    "The Fast Gradient Sign Method generates an adversarial example which maximizes loss by using gradients of the loss function with respect to the input image. With this method, we find out how much each input pixel contributes to the loss and add perturbations in order to maximize loss in the adversarial example.\n",
    "\n",
    "### BIM\n",
    "The Basic Iterative Method (BIM), also known as the Iterative FGSM (I-FGSM) is an extension of FGSM in which the attack performs a simple FGSM attack multiple times with smaller step sizes. \n",
    "\n",
    "### PGD\n",
    "The Projected Gradient Descent is a type of attack where the attacker has knowledge of the model’s gradients/weights. (A matrix that corresponds to how the model weighs each particular feature it detects) This threat model focuses on finding the perturbation that maximises the error of particular feature gradient of an input without crossing some threshold labelled as epsilon. The goal here is to find the minimum gradient of features that an input must contain to be classified incorrectly. \n",

You will notice, if you look closely, that the semantics of the images are not entirely lost, for you can discern the true label of the image to a high degree of accuracy. So, we acknowledge that we should maintain human semantics to test a model's intelligence; however, we assert that the semantics of these images have not entirely been lost."

    "## Analysis of Results\n",
    "By referencing the above results, it can be seen that the Athena Ensemble framework was able to successfuly defend a Convolutional Neural Network from adversarial examples with small epsilon values. An effective adversarial attack may be able to cause small perturbations to input data, even imperceptible to the human eye, in order to decrease a deep neural network's ability to classify input data accurately. Therefore, it is much more important for an adversarial defense strategy to be able to defend against these examples. In production, one may be able to use an adversarial classifier to filter out input data that deviates too much from expected input data. As the changes to this data becomes more imperceptible, it would be much more difficult for such a classifier to identify these adversarial examples. This creates a flaw in the adversarial robustness of the model. Through evaluating these examples with the Athena framework, it shows the ability to decrease the error rate of performing inference on input data with small changes, thus increasing the robustness. By comparing to the PGD-ADT model, it can be seen that the Athena framework not only defended against these samples accurately, but up to par with the state of the art. "
